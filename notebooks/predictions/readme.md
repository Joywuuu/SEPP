# Predictions

Using our models to my predictions, and scoring using hit-rate.

- Running the prediction methods on the North side of Chicago data, in batches.
- [Reload north](Reload%20north.ipynb) : Looks at the results.

We also ran all of the methods, in one go, on the South side of Chicago, see the script
`produce_preds.py`.  This script can be easily adapted to produce predictions for any
side of Chicago.
